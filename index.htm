		<em><h2>So, what is this here for?</h2></em>
			<p>Well, the idea is that this will serve as an "index" of sorts for all the stuff in my Dropbox folder that I'd like to be/don't mind being publically visible. Part of my inspiration for this comes from browsing around a couple of sites from those more skilled in this realm than I.</p>
			<p>So, this page will be doing double-duty; it is an index for you, and an educational project for me. :)</p>
		<h3>Here's some content for ya: the source code for "MARRPG", a simple battle system I wrote in TI-BASIC for the TI-83/84 family. Feel free to port it!</h3>
